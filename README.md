## GitHub-Learning
As part of my learning process and getting familiarised with Git & GitHub I have been keeping a detailed description of all that I have learned and as part of the learning I felt that setting up a repository for the notes I have made seems like a good practice, hence this repository.

There are only a few files included in this repository:
- The README that you will be reading right now.
- The Git & GitHub Notes which are all of my notes from my learning process.
- A Git Commands file - This one is blank right now, but will contain a list of all the commands I come across when learning and using Git.
